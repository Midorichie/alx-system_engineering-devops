1. For every additional element, why you are adding it:
   - Ensure each addition aligns with system objectives, such as scalability or redundancy, optimizing functionality.

2. Distribution algorithm your load balancer is configured with and how it works:
   - Load balancer distributes requests among servers using algorithms like Round Robin or Least Connections, optimizing resource utilization.

3. Load-balancer enabling an Active-Active or Active-Passive setup, explain the difference between both:
   - Active-Active utilizes all servers simultaneously, enhancing scalability, while Active-Passive designates one active server, providing redundancy with backups.

4. How a database Primary-Replica (Master-Slave) cluster works:
   - Primary node handles write operations and maintains data integrity, while replica nodes serve read queries and provide redundancy.
